# Second-Order AI-Writing Tells — Structural Pass for the Manual

`scripts/documentation-verify.py` is the first-order pass: phrases, marketing vocabulary,
tutorial voice, meta-references, dash misuse. Most AI-generated prose passes that filter and
still reads like AI, because the tells that survive a vocabulary fix are structural and
rhythmic. Run this pass only after the linter is clean; a page is done only when both passes
are clean.

Adapted from claude-blog's `ai-slop-detection.md` (MIT), which in turn adapts the impeccable
plugin's two-tier slop methodology (Paul Bakaus, Apache 2.0) and applies here to manual prose
instead of blog posts. Blog-only checks (listicle intro bloat, TL;DR boxes, question-heading
quotas *in favor* of questions) were dropped or inverted — a manual's norms differ.

## The tells

Report each hit with file:line and a quoted example. Thresholds are per page unless stated.

1. **Hedge stacking — the worst offender in a manual.** "may", "might", "often", "typically",
   "generally", "usually", "tends to". A manual states what the software does; a hedge on
   checkable behavior means the writer didn't check the code. Flag any 20-word window with
   more than one hedge, and *any* hedge on behavior that `Grep`/`Read` could settle. Hedges
   are legitimate only for genuinely environment-dependent behavior (OS quirks, driver
   timing), and then the sentence should name the condition instead of hedging.

2. **Question-cadence headings.** Outside `FAQ.md`, manual headings are noun phrases
   ("Free drivers", "Platform notes"). Flag any question-mark heading outside FAQ content.

3. **Uniform section shape.** Every H2 section lands at the same length with the same
   internal structure (paragraph, table, list — repeat). Real reference sections vary: UART
   needs a page, Process I/O needs a paragraph. Flag when 4+ consecutive sections share
   length within ±20% and identical element order.

4. **Symmetric list bloat.** Every bullet in a list is the same length (word-count SD < 5)
   with the same syntactic skeleton. Real lists vary; some items need three words, one needs
   two sentences. Also flag the bold-lead-in monotony variant: every bullet opening
   `**Term:** explanation` down an entire page.

5. **Bullet-itis.** Prose ideas chopped into bullets that each hold one sentence, or every
   section ending in a bullet list. Tables are for enumerable parameters; bullets are for
   genuinely parallel items; everything else is prose.

6. **Three-clause sentence rhythm.** Most sentences shaped `[clause], [clause], [clause].`
   in a row — the metronomic cadence. Flag when more than half the sentences in any 200-word
   window match.

7. **Triad tic.** Qualities always arriving in threes ("fast, reliable, and flexible").
   Flag 3+ triads per page.

8. **Capsule transitions.** Paragraphs or sections opening with a bare transition word:
   "First," "Next," "Additionally," "Crucially," "Furthermore,". Real prose buries
   transitions inside sentences. Flag when more than a third of paragraph openers do this.

9. **"Here's" openers.** "Here's how...", "Here's what...". Once is fine; three per page is
   a fingerprint.

10. **Wrap-up questions and summary paragraphs.** "What does this mean for you?" or an
    "In summary..." paragraph restating the section. A manual section ends when the
    information ends. Flag every instance outside FAQ content.

11. **False-balance framing.** "While X, it's also worth noting Y" with no real contrast —
    even-handedness theater. Flag more than one per page.

12. **"The key insight is..." / "What's important here is..."** as sentence openers — the
    model telegraphing a summary. Cut the opener; let the sentence stand.

13. **Opening-word repetition.** The same first word starting a large share of sentences
    (usually "The", "You", "This"). Flag when the top three first-words cover more than a
    quarter of all sentence openings on the page.

14. **Sentence-length flatness.** Sentences within a paragraph all nearly the same length
    (SD < 4 words). Technical prose still breathes: a short declarative after a long
    qualified one.

## Running the pass

- Read the whole page first; the tells are page-level patterns, not line-level phrases.
- Prefer counting to impressions for the threshold-based tells (2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14); quote
  one representative example per tell rather than every hit.
- When fixing, fix the structure, not the words — rewriting a hedge as a different hedge or
  re-shuffling a symmetric list keeps the tell. State what the code actually does, vary the
  shape, or delete.

## Report format

```
## Second-order pass: <page>

| # | Tell | Hits | Example (file:line) |
|---|------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | Hedge stacking | 3 | "typically may need..." (Drivers-Foo.md:42) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Verdict: PASS / FAIL (fail on any hit for tells 1, 2, 10, 12; thresholds otherwise)
